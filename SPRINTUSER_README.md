# Drupal 8 Sprint Package

This directory contains all the tools to get you going at a Drupal 8 sprint:

* Drupal 8, already cloned with git (`git clone git://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git`)
* Docker (you must install it yourself)
* DDEV-Local (ddev) development environment

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Install docker-ce if you don't already have it. Working installs for macOS and Windows are in the docker_installs directory. If you're running Linux, check Docker's website for install instructions. ()[Ubuntu instrutions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/))
2. (macOS/Linux): Install DDEV-Local by running install_ddev.sh in this directory: `./install_ddev.sh`
3. Start ddev with start_ddev.sh in this directory: `./start_ddev.sh`
